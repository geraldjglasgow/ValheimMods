    /// and the server-synced rules, so every peer computes the same numbers. On a dedicated server there is no local
    /// player: no aggregate, and the item hooks return on items without state.

    /// Phase 2 sends three things, each scoped: the hits the local player builds carry their changes to the target's
    /// owner (the game's own damage RPC, <see cref="OutgoingHits"/>); a creature's owner sends one routed RPC to the
    /// killer's peer on a kill (<see cref="KillCredit"/>); and the player's own client publishes the few totals other
    /// peers apply - stagger length, taming, sailing, gathering, light, mist - on its player ZDO when they change
    /// (<see cref="PlayerStats"/>). Summons carry their staff's bonus in their own ZDO (<see cref="Summons"/>).
