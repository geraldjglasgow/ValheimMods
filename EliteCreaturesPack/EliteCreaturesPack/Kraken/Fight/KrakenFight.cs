    /// <see cref="ShipHold"/>) and the fight goes round two phases until it dies, `Phase Attacks` attacks each (six by
    /// default), one attack at a time, a random `Attack Gap Min` to `Attack Gap Max` seconds apart with three or more
    /// aboard, a bit longer with two (`Gap Factor Pair`) and a little longer alone (`Gap Factor Solo`), and quicker under the
    /// ship (`Tentacle Gap Factor`). Under the ship: the
    /// six tentacles rise round the hull and slam across the deck one after another, each at the player nearest to it;
    /// one of those (never the first) is the grab, which roars a warning and flings whoever it catches into the sea.
    /// Then the head comes up beside the ship, level with most of the crew, on the side with no ladder (or the crew's
    /// side when both have one, off the ladder), and bites whoever is at the rail, spits ink at
    /// whoever is further off and, while the ink recovers, throws its whole head over the rail at whoever is within its
    /// reach on the deck; about every `Ship Hit Interval` seconds its turn is a tentacle from the far side smashing
    /// across the ship itself. Then back under the ship, and round again. With no one aboard for a while, or the ship
    /// gone, it lets go and leaves. A stagger (a parried bite or ink, or enough damage at once) calls off whatever was
    /// about to land and holds the next attack back a moment.
