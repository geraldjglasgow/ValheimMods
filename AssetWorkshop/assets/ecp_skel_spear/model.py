"""The skeleton arsenal's spear (Elite Creatures Pack), v2: the head is a vertebra. Its body is the socket, bound with
sinew onto the end of a shaft whose upper half, the fist's half, is a spine - sixteen big tail vertebrae stacked end to
end, a disc of cartilage between each pair, gently curving below the head - and whose lower half is two long bones
laid end to end, bound in sinew, the bottom one's knuckles the butt. The head lies flat in the blade's plane with the
canal showing through, its wings stand out to the sides as the lugs, and its spine is drawn out and ground into a broad leaf
point.

Weapon axes (see ecp_skel_arsenal), but reversed like the game's own spears: the fist at the origin, the head down +Y
(Unity -Z) 1.08 m away and the butt 1.35 m up -Y, since the spear clips hold it overhand (SpearBronze and SpearFlint
both). Built head up -Y first and turned half round Z at the end. The blade's flats face Z. 2.43 m long. v1 (a bone
leaf point with a vertebra collar) is archived in assets/skeleton_weapons_v1.
