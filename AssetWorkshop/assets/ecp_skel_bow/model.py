"""The skeleton arsenal's bow (Elite Creatures Pack), v2: limbs of backbone. Each limb is a column of vertebrae,
biggest at the grip and smaller towards the tip, threaded on a rib that gives the bow its bend (angular like the
skeleton's own, Characters/Skeleton/weapons/skeleton_bow), their spines standing out on the bow's back and their wings
to the sides, like the game's Spinesnap; the grip is bound in dark hide between the two biggest, the arrow riding over
the upper one; finger bones cap both tips for nocks. The string is not part of the model: the bow's wielder draws it
(the showcase stretches it from the tips to the drawing fingers).

Built upright (the top tip up -Y, the string side +X, the flats facing Z), then turned into the game's hold: the
skeletons hold their bow slanted in the left fist (skeleton_bow's attach frame: the stave through the fist, its string
0.35 m behind the grip along STRING, the limbs along LIMBS; measured from the game's mesh, Blender axes). The build
writes out/ecp_skel_bow_points.json: the tips, the rest (where the arrow passes the bow) and the string's middle at
rest, turned, in Blender and in Unity axes. About 1.34 m tip to tip. v1 (two ribs with a vertebra shelf) is archived
in assets/skeleton_weapons_v1.
