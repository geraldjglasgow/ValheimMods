    /// <item><b>Fall push</b>, on the tree's owner. TreeBase.SpawnLog instantiates the log at m_logSpawnPoint (halfway up
    /// the trunk, about where the log's centre of mass is), multiplies its Rigidbody mass by the tree's scale.x and
    /// adds the impulse hitDir × 0.2 × mass at the log's position + up × 4 × scale.y (ForceMode.Impulse): a nudge that
    /// tips the top over along the felling hit. <see cref="Felling"/> calls <see cref="OnFelled"/> right after, in the
    /// same frame, and the same impulse is added again times the woodcutter's share, the same way on the same body.
    /// Impulses on a Rigidbody add up until the next physics step, so the log starts with (1 + share) × the game's
    /// push. The log belongs to this machine: its physics run here and ZSyncTransform shows the fall to everybody.</item>
    /// <item><b>Aim.</b> The extra push follows only the horizontal part of the felling hit, at the hit's full length.
    /// A swing's direction runs from the attack's origin at chest height to the point hit on the bark
    /// (Attack.DoMeleeAttack), so it tilts with the slope and the chopping height, and a tilt would only lift the log
    /// or press it into the stump. Flattened, all of it tips the trunk away from the woodcutter. For a tree knocked over
    /// by another log the direction is the striking log's motion at the contact (ImpactEffect), mostly downward;
    /// flattened, the chain carries on the way the first tree fell.</item>
    /// <item><b>Size.</b> The impulse is proportional to the mass, so the speed it gives is the same for every log:
    /// 0.2 m/s along the ground per game's push, plus a turn. At the default (×10 at level 100) the top of a pine log
    /// starts at about 8 m/s, below the 20 m/s or so it reaches when a log lands on its own (the game's gravity is
    /// 20 m/s²). The largest setting (×31) gives about 6 m/s and 25 m/s: rough, not a fling, and the game bounds the
    /// rest: 7 rad/s maximum angular speed, TreeLog.Awake's maxDepenetrationVelocity of 1, and ImpactEffect's damage
    /// reaching its full value at m_maxVelocity (5 m/s), so a harder push never makes a log hit harder. The only
    /// clamps are the setting's range and the level's.</item>
