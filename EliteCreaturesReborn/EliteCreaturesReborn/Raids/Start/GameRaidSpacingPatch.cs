    /// where it may happen (<c>RandEventSystem.GetValidEventPoints</c>, for the timed roll, the standalone events and the
    /// `randomevent` command alike), so the places near a chest raid are struck from that list: the game then draws among
    /// the rest, or starts nothing this time, exactly as when no player qualifies. Everything else about base raids stays
    /// the game's. An admin's `event` command names its own place and is left alone. The list is asked for once per event
    /// on the same frame with the same players, so each place is looked up once a frame. The game rolls an event every
    /// few in-game minutes, so the lookup (the hosts' ZDOs around a point, <see cref="RaidSpacing.ChestRaidNear"/>) is
    /// never on a hot path. A failure is reported and swallowed, leaving the game's list as it was.
