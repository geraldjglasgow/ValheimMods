    /// stopped, walks off when it is lost, and drops its own loot times the raid's drops - but it is on no wave's roster
    /// (<see cref="RaidRoster"/>, which only the host's owner writes), so the raid is won once the waves are beaten and a
    /// copy left then walks off. Read from the parent's ZDO in the death patch's prefix while the ZDO still answers

    /// is made, on the machine that makes it and so owns it. A creature that is no raider hands down nothing.
