    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>"not sensed for 30 s", and the leash that drops a target a second after losing it once the creature is past
    /// its maximum chase distance from its spawn point, both run on the time since it last sensed its target: held at 0.</item>
    /// <item>"no attack for 60 s" drops a target unless the creature hunts players; "no attack for 30 s while being hurt"
    /// makes it run away. Both run on the time since it last attacked, which is held at 30 s. The 15 s mark that sends a
    /// creature that cannot reach its target after the buildings in the way still passes, so it still breaks in.</item>
    /// <item>A tame drops any target further than its alert range from the player it follows or the spot it guards; a
    /// tame's quarry is put back, so it hunts its enemies down wherever they run (never a friend: a friend is no quarry).</item>

    /// stays alert, so the moment it spends on a wall or away from a fire never lets the game send it home.</item>
