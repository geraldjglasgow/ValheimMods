    /// broadcast (see <see cref="EliteRpc"/>), which names the corpse by id - the ragdoll that very death made (see
    /// <see cref="DeathRagdoll"/>) - so each client finds its own copy of that one corpse and never a neighbour's lying
    /// nearby. It follows the body wherever it slides or rolls, so the thing that looks like it is about to explode is
    /// the thing that is. Ragdoll physics is not synchronised, so each client's corpse settles a little differently -
    /// that divergence is only cosmetic here. It also keeps the corpse from vanishing on its own timer before the blast
    /// (see <see cref="CorpseBurst"/>). When the fuse ends, ONLY the owner's rider broadcasts the blast at its corpse's
    /// resting place, naming the same corpse for the blast to burst, so the blast everyone sees and the damage the owner
    /// deals are the same spot. A death that left no ragdoll, or a corpse that never reaches this client, leaves the
    /// warning and the blast at the place of death - better a blast in the right area than none.
