    /// two-star one with three players - in every loot mode, Vanilla included (the user, 2026-10-04). A head per
    /// player and per star is a count the group can read before the fight, not a quantity to roll or multiply, so it

    /// Bountiful boss drops twelve heads), rounded. The table decides, not the game's roll: a trophy row in the
    /// boss's table pays even if its
    /// chance (1 on every vanilla boss) came up empty. The engine holds these rows out of the list before any rule
    /// runs and pays them back last, so nothing in between can scale or reroll them; a row the rule file adds for
    /// the same item still adds on top. The exception is a trophy the boss's `creatures:` entry names under `drop
    /// overrides`: the server's own words, left to the engine as before. Every boss that dies in its own right pays
