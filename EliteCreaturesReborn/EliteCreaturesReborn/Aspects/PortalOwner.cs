    /// boss starts a portal-carried attack (<see cref="PortalAttacks"/>) at a creature, it looks for a spot for the far
    /// portal around that target (<see cref="PortalSpots"/>) and writes it into the boss's ZDO with the moment it opened
    /// (<see cref="PortalStore"/>); with no spot, the attack is thrown as the game made it. When the game lets the
    /// projectiles go (the Elder's vines, Bonemass's slime), each one leaves from the far portal's face for the target's
    /// middle, where the target is at that moment, instead of from the boss: straight at it, or along the arc that lands
    /// on it for one that falls (<see cref="PortalAim"/>); the game still adds its own spread. The moment of the first one
    /// is written too, which opens the portal at the hand everywhere. When the attack ends both portals close a little
    /// later; cut short before the throw (a stagger, a death), they close at once. Every write carries the latest closing
    /// time, so the portals close on time even if this machine stops owning the boss mid-attack. Nothing is drawn here.
