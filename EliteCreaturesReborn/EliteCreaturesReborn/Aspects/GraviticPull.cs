    /// speed`, sideways movement is left alone, and moving toward the boss faster than that is never slowed. Because the
    /// game applies it as its own intent, nothing in its movement undoes it, physics still stops the player at walls
    /// and rocks, and the game's own rule that the feet steer only on the ground makes a jump a brief escape. In water the
    /// game carries its swim velocity from step to step, so each step's push is taken back at the start of the next
    /// (<see cref="Repay"/>): a swimmer stops drifting the moment the pull ends.
