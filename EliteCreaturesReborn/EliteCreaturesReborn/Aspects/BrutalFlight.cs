    /// velocity, lets go of the ground and ignores the ground for the game's 0.1 s jump guard, so the walking code treats
    /// the player as airborne from the first step. From then until they land, the game's walking intent is replaced by the
    /// body's own velocity where the game adds a knockback (<see cref="Patches.BrutalFlightPatch"/>), so neither the
    /// player's own air control, the stride of an attack nor the hit's ordinary shove eats into the flight: gravity alone
    /// brings them down, walls and rocks still stop them, and a slow-fall cape still slows the fall.
    /// The flight ends on touching the ground, in water, when something holds them, at death, or after
    /// <see cref="Longest"/> seconds in any case. No fall damage lands from the moment of the throw until
    /// <see cref="Settle"/> seconds after it ends (<see cref="Forgives"/>, checked where the game sends its fall hit), so
    /// a bounce or a slide off the landing spot is soft too; a fall that starts after that counts in full, measured as
    /// the game always does from the last ground they stood on. Nothing else is forgiven: the game deals no damage for
    /// striking a wall or a rock, and a moving log or cart hits a thrown player as it would a standing one.
