    /// of its own, so it is taken from the piece's prefab and cloned locally through <see cref="CosmeticClone"/> (the
    /// player's effect density applies), centred on the portal, and set to follow the portal's scale so it can open and
    /// close by growing and shrinking. Around it a thin glowing rim, drawn whatever the effect density because it is
    /// the warning itself: it borrows the Stormbound circle's soft band (<see cref="StormEffects.RingMaterial"/>),
    /// tinted the portal's orange. A portal opens with the game's portal-opening sound. The aspects block of the rule
