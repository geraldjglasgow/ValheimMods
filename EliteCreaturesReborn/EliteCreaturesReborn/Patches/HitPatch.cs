    /// feature of this mod that acts on a hit at the normal priority, asked in turn in the order they ran when each was a
    /// patch of its own. Before the hit: the Brutal mark (<see cref="BrutalHitPatch"/>), Warding's capture
    /// (<see cref="DamageReactionPatch"/>), the scaling (<see cref="DamageScalingPatch"/>), the devour bite
    /// (<see cref="DevourHitPatch"/>), the death recap's source (<see cref="RecapSourcePatch"/>), the Screecher's health
    /// (<see cref="ShriekDamagePatch"/>) and the Thieving dodge test (<see cref="ThievingHitPatch"/>). After it: the
    /// Brutal throw, the reactions (Warding, Leeching, Reflective), the forced devour, the shriek and the steal. The
    /// parts they all ask for are looked up once a side (<see cref="Struck"/>), the attacker again after the reactions,
    /// which can kill it. Each step keeps its own guard: the ones that never throw still swallow and report, the rest
    /// still report and rethrow, which stops the steps after them exactly as a throwing patch stopped the patches after
    /// it. Frostbound's heal (<see cref="FrostHealPatch"/>, first before and last after) and the Cloning decoy's blow
    /// (<see cref="CloneHitPatch"/>, last before) keep their own patches, because their place is set by priority.
