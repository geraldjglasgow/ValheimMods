    /// The instant a boss's blow lands, handed to a Colossal boss's behaviour, which weighs it and sends the shockwave.
    /// Hooked on the two methods that deal the blow - the melee sweep and the area burst - which the game calls from
    /// <c>Attack.OnAttackTrigger</c> at the impact frame of the attack's animation, only on the attacker's owner and only
    /// while the attack is still live. So a swing the game cancels (the boss staggered, the owner changed mid-swing)
    /// shakes nothing, exactly as it hits nothing. Projectile, taunt and breath attacks never reach either method. It runs
    /// inside the game's attack, so a failure is reported and swallowed rather than cutting the attack short.
