    /// devourer is off its cooldown, has not yet eaten its one creature per star, and the prey's current health is within
    /// `max prey health` percent of its own (100 by default: no more than its own; see <see cref="DevourLimits"/>; all of
    /// it is read from the two creatures' prefabs and replicated ZDOs, so no routing is needed). Any other landed attack
    /// is an ordinary hit:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>The <b>prefix</b> commits the kill before vanilla resolves the hit - it marks the prey with the devourer's id
    /// (so the prey's death path feeds that one devourer, see <see cref="DeathPatch"/>) and fires the sound
    /// tell, once. Marking here, not in the postfix, means a well-fed devourer whose ordinary damage would have finished
    /// the prey outright still routes its death as a devour.</item>
    /// <item>The <b>postfix</b> forces the kill if the prey survived the hit's own damage, by draining it and running the
    /// death check - so it dies this bite with no health bar and no fight, whatever its health was.</item>
    /// </list>
    /// The postfix also handles the reverse role: a player striking the devourer <see cref="DevourBehaviour.Provoke"/>s
    /// it, turning it on that player. Players are never devoured; Devouring's zeroed knockback lives in DamageScalingPatch.
    /// Both halves are steps of <see cref="HitPatch"/>.
