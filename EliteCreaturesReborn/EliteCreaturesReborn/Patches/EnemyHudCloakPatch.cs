    /// its body is veiled mid-blink, so the plate never lingers at the spot it left, and a Cloning one while it hides
    /// behind its decoy (<see cref="CloneBehaviour.Hidden"/>), so only the decoy's plate shows and nothing marks where the
    /// creature really is; the decoy's own plate reads the same name, stars and health. An Echoing boss's echo never shows
    /// one (<see cref="EchoLink"/>): it is a ghost of the fight, not a second boss. The game asks this for every
    /// creature near the player each frame, so the hidden ones are found in one lookup (<see cref="PlateVeils"/>), and
    /// with none loaded it is one count check.
