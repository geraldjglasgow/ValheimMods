    /// Applies the attack-speed part of star scaling and Mad, and Tethered's live boost as the pair's health draws apart
    /// (<see cref="TetherLink.SwingFactor"/>). The game resets a creature's animator speed to 1 each fixed
    /// step, but only while it is idle or moving - during an attack, a minor action, an emote or a stagger it leaves the
    /// value alone. So the scaled speed is written absolutely inside that same window and the attack inherits it for its
    /// whole swing; multiplying the live value would compound once per fixed step and run away. Runs on every machine
    /// (animation is local); the factor comes from synced traits and, for Tethered, from the pair's health in their ZDOs,
    /// so every client animates it the same. Tethered's part changes from step to step, which the absolute write takes
    /// as it comes: the fixed factor times the live one, never times the animator's current speed.
    /// It runs for every character's animator, players included, so it asks <see cref="SwingRegistry"/> first and leaves
    /// at once for anything at its own speed: one lookup, nothing allocated. Exceptions are reported the way
    /// <see cref="Guard.Run(string, Action)"/> reports them, inline so the step allocates no closure.
