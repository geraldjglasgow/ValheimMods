    /// Makes a Gilded creature run. On the owner - the only machine where the AI steps at all - a Gilded creature with a
    /// player in sight (<see cref="GildedBehaviour.FleeFrom"/>) spends the step fleeing instead of thinking: the base
    /// AI's upkeep runs (regeneration, timers, take-off and landing), then the game's own flee takes it to a reachable
    /// point away from the player, re-picked every couple of seconds, exactly as a creature flees fire. It is alerted
    /// first so it runs rather than walks. The MonsterAI's own step is skipped rather than overridden afterwards,
    /// because the AI caches its path for a second: a step that had already walked it somewhere would drag the flee
    /// along that same path. When no player is in sight the step is the game's, untouched - and even then it cannot
    /// pick a player to fight, because a Gilded creature has no player enemies (<see cref="GildedEnemyPatch"/>).
    /// Movement and the alert replicate through the game's own sync, so every client sees it bolt. For every other
    /// creature the cost is one static check, plus one dictionary lookup only while a Gilded creature is loaded. A
    /// failure is logged once and swallowed, and the step falls back to the game's: every creature's AI must still run.
