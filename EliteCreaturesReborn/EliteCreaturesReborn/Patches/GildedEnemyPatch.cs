    /// job. Asymmetric like the Devouring override (<see cref="EnemyPatch"/>): only the Gilded creature's own view
    /// changes, so players still fight it and its health bar still reads as an enemy's. An animal is not registered and
    /// keeps players as enemies, because that is what makes it run from them. <see cref="Vanilla"/> asks the game's
    /// own answer for the flee check - a player the game would not call its enemy, a tamed creature's friend, is nobody
    /// to run from - and while it asks, every mod override stands aside (<see cref="GameOnly"/>, which the Devouring
    /// override honours too), so a Gilded devourer that is feeding still sees players as the threat they are. The
    /// game's friend searches (<see cref="GildedFriendPatch"/>) also get the game's own answer: "not an enemy" must not
    /// turn a player into a friend to heal or buff. It runs last among the IsEnemy postfixes, so the answer is its own
    /// whatever else has overridden it. IsEnemy is asked constantly, so the first test is one static check.
